# Comparing two files and merging them using vscode\

I usually have vscode around and not use it for much, but today I learned that you can use vscode as a quick alternative to `meld`. On mac it takes some time to install using `brew` so here the magic:

```
code --diff "path/to/file/a" "path/to/file/b"
```
